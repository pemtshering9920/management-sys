Project: Fees RecordBook Module PHP/MySQLi with Source Code

About
Fees RecordBook is a simple PHP/MySQLi project that may help, manage their student's fee payments module. This project stores fees per course and level.
Talking about the fees per course and level, each course and level list the detailed calculation of the school fees,
which means the fees per course and level can have multiple lists such as the tuition, miscellaneous, 
and other types of fees for the certain course and level. The school fees payment system also stores the student list and the list of student fees which means 
on the Student Fees list, it is possible that a certain student has a double entry which is not because they have a different Enrollment Number or EF. No. and 
this field are to identify the payable fee of the student per semester although there is no section or feature in this project for managing the semester of 
the school which is why I only use the enrollment number. The payment feature in this project has only a simple process which is enough for managing the payment, 
generate a receipt, and generate the payment summary per student's semester. This project also generates monthly payment reports for school management reference 
purposes.
